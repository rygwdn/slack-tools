# Command Handling Guidelines

## Workspace Selection

- Always default to using "Build" as the workspace when running commands
- Allow explicit workspace specification via command line arguments

## Command Safety

- Classify all commands as either "safe" or "unsafe":
  - Safe commands (read-only): print, test, today, search, list, help
  - Unsafe commands (modify data): post, update, delete, create, modify, send, status
- Never automatically run commands that modify Slack data without permission
- Always run commands and verify output before assuming task completion
- Wait for user approval before running any command that mutates data

## Command Implementation

- Each command should have a clear, single responsibility
- Implement proper error handling and validation
- Provide helpful usage examples in help text
- Follow consistent parameter naming across commands
- Support both required and optional parameters appropriately

## Command Format

```bash
# General format
slack-tools [options] <command> [command-options]

# Global options
# -w, --workspace <workspace>  Specify Slack workspace URL or name
# -l, --last-workspace         Use the last used workspace
# -d, --debug                  Enable debug mode for detailed logging
```
