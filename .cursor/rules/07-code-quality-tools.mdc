# Code Quality Tools

## ESLint Configuration

The project uses ESLint with TypeScript support to catch potential errors and enforce consistent code style. The configuration is in `eslint.config.mjs` with the following key features:

- TypeScript-specific rules through typescript-eslint
- Warnings for `any` type usage
- Strict unused variable checking
- Integration with Prettier to avoid formatting conflicts

## Prettier Configuration

The project uses Prettier for consistent code formatting with the following settings:
- Single quotes for strings
- 2-space indentation
- 100 character line length
- Trailing commas in multiline objects and arrays
