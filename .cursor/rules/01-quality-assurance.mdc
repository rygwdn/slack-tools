# Quality Assurance Requirements

Before any task is considered complete, the following quality checks must be run:

## Run All Checks in Parallel

The easiest way to run all quality checks is using the check script:
```bash
npm run check
```

This runs ESLint, Prettier checks, TypeScript type checking, and tests in parallel, then builds the project.

## Individual Checks

You can also run individual checks:

1. **ESLint** - Check for code style and potential errors:
   ```bash
   npm run lint
   ```
   Fix any linting errors before submitting:
   ```bash
   npm run lint:fix
   ```

2. **Prettier** - Format all code consistently:
   ```bash
   npm run format
   ```
   Verify formatting is correct:
   ```bash
   npm run format:check
   ```

3. **TypeScript** - Ensure all type checks pass:
   ```bash
   npm run typecheck
   ```

4. **Build** - Compile the project:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

**Note:** No task should be considered complete until all checks have passed without errors.

## Development Workflow

1. Make your code changes
2. Run all checks: `npm run check` (or individual checks as needed)
3. Fix any issues found in the checks
4. Commit your changes only after all checks pass
