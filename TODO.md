- auth retrieval isn't working
  - load auth from chrome?
  - manual auth (use proxyman/chrome to find cookie & token)
  - recommend running with debug logging if auth fails

- update docs on search
- check annotations to tools
- make consistent use of markdown formatter tool
- channel names not resolving
